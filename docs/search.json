With a p-value of 0.0208, we reject the null hypothesis that the birth month distributions are the same. This suggests a real bias in birth month representation among NHL players, where they are more likely to be born in the first quarter of the year.\nWhile this finding aligns with the concept of the relative age effect (RAE)—where players born earlier in the year may have a competitive advantage—it’s important to recognize that other factors such as sample size, dataset variations, or specific characteristics of the NHL player pool could influence these results. Further research might consider these factors to deepen our understanding of birth month biases in hockey and other sports.\nData Source:\nThis analysis uses data from the TidyTuesday project for the week of January 9, 2024, accessed via the tidytuesdayR package and the TidyTuesday GitHub repository: https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/main/data/2024/2024-01-09\nDirect provenance for each dataset:\nCanadian Births (1991-2022): This dataset includes monthly birth counts for Canadian residents from 1991 to 2022.

This step, implemented using a negative lookahead (^(?!.seasons).\\d+), allowed me to isolate only actual movie runtimes (e.g., “90 minutes”) for a more reliable analysis. The scatter plot reveals a slight decreasing trend in movie lengths from 1940 to 2020. While we can’t infer Netflix’s intentions or content strategy from this pattern alone—since changes could reflect shifts in genre popularity or catalog composition—it does suggest a general trend toward shorter films in the dataset. To reduce the noise from individual data points, the second plot groups movie lengths by decade.

Including this narrative perspective helps contextualize the observed patterns without assuming intent behind them.\n\n\nHow many titles on Netflix use “The” in it?\n\nthe_count &lt;- sum(str_detect(netflix_titles[[\"title\"]], \"\\\\bthe\\\\b\"))\nthe_count\n\n[1] 558\n\n\nI used a regular expression to count how many titles on Netflix contain the word “the,” using the pattern \\bthe\\b.

This helps identify how often titles reference specific years, which could suggest biographical, historical, or period-themed content. The output was 42 titles, indicating that such date references are relatively uncommon in the dataset.\nAnalysis on Tables/Plots:\nThis dataset offers valuable insights into trends within Netflix’s catalog, highlighting patterns in genre frequency and movie lengths over time. While these findings do not reveal Netflix’s internal strategy or intent, they do show which genres appear most often and how movie runtimes have varied across different decades.

    "title": "Ethics: Data and Power",
    "section": "",
    "text": "TikTok’s popularity is driven in part by its ability to show users hyper-personalized content and advertisements through machine learning algorithms. These algorithms analyze behavioral data such as watch time, likes, replays, and comments to create a “For You” feed and deliver targeted ads. Behind the scenes, this involves extensive user profiling, predictive modeling, and the inference of demographic characteristics such as gender and age. While TikTok does not always collect demographic data directly, public documentation like the 2021 Privacy Policy suggests that behavioral signals are used to estimate user traits—though the specific methods are not fully disclosed.\nThis process raises several ethical concerns. How much do users actually consent to? Is the data really anonymous? Can inferred attributes lead to discrimination? This project explores four key ethical dilemmas embedded in TikTok’s data practices.\n\n\nOne of the central issues is whether users have meaningfully consented to TikTok’s data collection and use. As Barocas & Nissenbaum (2009) explain, the typical “notice and consent” model fails to provide genuine understanding of how data will be used—especially when future uses are unclear or hidden behind complex policy language. TikTok’s 2021 Privacy Policy describes the collection of behavioral data for purposes like improving services and targeting ads. However, it does not clearly outline the full extent of personalization or profiling algorithms used to infer user characteristics, nor the third parties involved in data sharing (TikTok, 2021). Given the opacity of these systems and how often users accept terms without reading them, true informed consent is likely not possible. Furthermore, as Barocas & Nissenbaum also point out, app design often includes dark patterns—subtle design tricks that nudge users to accept permissions without realizing their implications. This raises the question: can users really opt out of a system that is designed to obscure their choices?\nIt is also worth considering that TikTok likely views “improving services” as a broad umbrella under which profiling algorithms are deployed. This raises an ethical issue not only of transparency but also of whether users even have a clear understanding of the actual consequences of consenting to such data collection, particularly when the systems are so complex and opaque. It is possible that the “improving services” language conceals the more intrusive aspects of TikTok’s data practices, such as the detailed profiling algorithms it uses for ad targeting.\n\n\n\nTikTok claims that some of its data is anonymized or aggregated, but this doesn’t guarantee privacy. According to Leetaru (2016), even supposedly anonymous data can often be re-identified when combined with other data sources, a process known as “mosaicking.” For example, details like location, usage patterns, and device metadata can often be linked back to individuals, especially when tied to inferred demographic profiles. If TikTok uses behavioral cues to infer traits like age or gender and combines them with device identifiers or app usage metadata, the risk of re-identification becomes real. This is especially troubling for users who believe their data is anonymous when, in fact, it may still expose them to targeting or profiling.\nThis risk becomes even more critical if TikTok shares this data with third parties or if there is a data breach. However, if the data were only used in-house, the likelihood of this re-identification risk might be reduced, though it would still depend on the robustness of TikTok’s internal privacy protections and the degree to which the data is effectively anonymized. Even without data being shared externally, the company’s ability to re-identify users based on aggregated data highlights significant privacy concerns, especially as this anonymized data may still be leveraged for highly specific ad targeting.\n\n\n\nTikTok’s algorithms may also use behavioral data in ways that were not explicitly stated in its policies, leading to unintended consequences. For example, content engagement patterns can be used to infer when users are feeling vulnerable or emotionally unstable—data that advertisers or recommendation engines could exploit. This creates ethical concerns, especially for younger users or those struggling with mental health. As Barocas & Nissenbaum (2009) warn, data collected for one purpose may be repurposed for another, potentially harming users who were unaware of such risks. When TikTok’s algorithm detects that a user is binge-watching certain types of content (e.g., related to body image or depression), it may double down and promote similar content, potentially reinforcing harmful behavior. This scenario reflects how data can be used in unintended, damaging ways that affect both individuals and communities.\nIf TikTok’s data is used only in-house, it might mitigate some of the risks of exploitation, but it does not fully address the ethical concern that the data might still lead to harm by inadvertently reinforcing negative behaviors. The algorithms themselves, especially in their reliance on user behavior, can cause undue influence by continually promoting content that could further exploit or exacerbate the emotional states of users. The unintended consequences of such a feedback loop could perpetuate harmful patterns, particularly if vulnerable users are continuously exposed to content that reinforces negative body image, mental health struggles, or other damaging behaviors.\n\n\n\nTikTok does not ask users for race or gender directly, but it still infers these attributes using behavioral patterns, language, and possibly facial features from videos—though TikTok has not publicly confirmed all technical details. This practice aligns with Buolamwini & Gebru’s (2018) work on algorithmic bias, which shows how demographic inferences can lead to discriminatory outcomes—especially when training data is not representative or when inferred demographics become proxies for exclusion. If TikTok’s ad system uses inferred gender or race to determine who sees certain ads or content, this could result in proxy discrimination. For example, an advertiser may unintentionally exclude users that the algorithm identifies as “less profitable” based on biased inferences. The ethical dilemma here is not just whether race or gender should be used—but whether the algorithm is replicating or reinforcing social inequalities through proxies it was never explicitly told to use.\nEven if TikTok does not directly collect demographic information, the algorithms’ ability to infer characteristics like gender and race may still create opportunities for proxy discrimination that disproportionately affects marginalized groups. If the algorithms reinforce biases or make assumptions based on incomplete data, it could lead to biased ad targeting, limiting users’ access to certain products or services based on demographic assumptions that might not even be accurate. This further complicates the ethical landscape, as the platform’s data-driven decisions could inadvertently perpetuate inequality in ways that are difficult for users to challenge or even recognize."

    "text": "TikTok’s popularity is driven in part by its ability to show users hyper-personalized content and advertisements through machine learning algorithms. These algorithms analyze behavioral data such as watch time, likes, replays, and comments to create a “For You” feed and deliver targeted ads. Behind the scenes, this involves extensive user profiling, predictive modeling, and the inference of demographic characteristics such as gender and age. While TikTok does not always collect demographic data directly, public documentation like the 2021 Privacy Policy suggests that behavioral signals are used to estimate user traits—though the specific methods are not fully disclosed.\nThis process raises several ethical concerns. How much do users actually consent to? Is the data really anonymous? Can inferred attributes lead to discrimination? This project explores four key ethical dilemmas embedded in TikTok’s data practices.\n\n\nOne of the central issues is whether users have meaningfully consented to TikTok’s data collection and use. As Barocas & Nissenbaum (2009) explain, the typical “notice and consent” model fails to provide genuine understanding of how data will be used—especially when future uses are unclear or hidden behind complex policy language. TikTok’s 2021 Privacy Policy describes the collection of behavioral data for purposes like improving services and targeting ads. However, it does not clearly outline the full extent of personalization or profiling algorithms used to infer user characteristics, nor the third parties involved in data sharing (TikTok, 2021). Given the opacity of these systems and how often users accept terms without reading them, true informed consent is likely not possible. Furthermore, as Barocas & Nissenbaum also point out, app design often includes dark patterns—subtle design tricks that nudge users to accept permissions without realizing their implications. This raises the question: can users really opt out of a system that is designed to obscure their choices?\nIt is also worth considering that TikTok likely views “improving services” as a broad umbrella under which profiling algorithms are deployed. This raises an ethical issue not only of transparency but also of whether users even have a clear understanding of the actual consequences of consenting to such data collection, particularly when the systems are so complex and opaque. It is possible that the “improving services” language conceals the more intrusive aspects of TikTok’s data practices, such as the detailed profiling algorithms it uses for ad targeting.\n\n\n\nTikTok claims that some of its data is anonymized or aggregated, but this doesn’t guarantee privacy. According to Leetaru (2016), even supposedly anonymous data can often be re-identified when combined with other data sources, a process known as “mosaicking.” For example, details like location, usage patterns, and device metadata can often be linked back to individuals, especially when tied to inferred demographic profiles. If TikTok uses behavioral cues to infer traits like age or gender and combines them with device identifiers or app usage metadata, the risk of re-identification becomes real. This is especially troubling for users who believe their data is anonymous when, in fact, it may still expose them to targeting or profiling.\nThis risk becomes even more critical if TikTok shares this data with third parties or if there is a data breach. However, if the data were only used in-house, the likelihood of this re-identification risk might be reduced, though it would still depend on the robustness of TikTok’s internal privacy protections and the degree to which the data is effectively anonymized. Even without data being shared externally, the company’s ability to re-identify users based on aggregated data highlights significant privacy concerns, especially as this anonymized data may still be leveraged for highly specific ad targeting.\n\n\n\nTikTok’s algorithms may also use behavioral data in ways that were not explicitly stated in its policies, leading to unintended consequences. For example, content engagement patterns can be used to infer when users are feeling vulnerable or emotionally unstable—data that advertisers or recommendation engines could exploit. This creates ethical concerns, especially for younger users or those struggling with mental health. As Barocas & Nissenbaum (2009) warn, data collected for one purpose may be repurposed for another, potentially harming users who were unaware of such risks. When TikTok’s algorithm detects that a user is binge-watching certain types of content (e.g., related to body image or depression), it may double down and promote similar content, potentially reinforcing harmful behavior. This scenario reflects how data can be used in unintended, damaging ways that affect both individuals and communities.\nIf TikTok’s data is used only in-house, it might mitigate some of the risks of exploitation, but it does not fully address the ethical concern that the data might still lead to harm by inadvertently reinforcing negative behaviors. The algorithms themselves, especially in their reliance on user behavior, can cause undue influence by continually promoting content that could further exploit or exacerbate the emotional states of users. The unintended consequences of such a feedback loop could perpetuate harmful patterns, particularly if vulnerable users are continuously exposed to content that reinforces negative body image, mental health struggles, or other damaging behaviors.\n\n\n\nTikTok does not ask users for race or gender directly, but it still infers these attributes using behavioral patterns, language, and possibly facial features from videos—though TikTok has not publicly confirmed all technical details. This practice aligns with Buolamwini & Gebru’s (2018) work on algorithmic bias, which shows how demographic inferences can lead to discriminatory outcomes—especially when training data is not representative or when inferred demographics become proxies for exclusion. If TikTok’s ad system uses inferred gender or race to determine who sees certain ads or content, this could result in proxy discrimination. For example, an advertiser may unintentionally exclude users that the algorithm identifies as “less profitable” based on biased inferences. The ethical dilemma here is not just whether race or gender should be used—but whether the algorithm is replicating or reinforcing social inequalities through proxies it was never explicitly told to use.\nEven if TikTok does not directly collect demographic information, the algorithms’ ability to infer characteristics like gender and race may still create opportunities for proxy discrimination that disproportionately affects marginalized groups. If the algorithms reinforce biases or make assumptions based on incomplete data, it could lead to biased ad targeting, limiting users’ access to certain products or services based on demographic assumptions that might not even be accurate. This further complicates the ethical landscape, as the platform’s data-driven decisions could inadvertently perpetuate inequality in ways that are difficult for users to challenge or even recognize."

The gap between male and female stops is consistent, but Texas records a particularly large number of male stops relative to the other two states. California has about 5 million more male stops than North Caroline but the number of stop for women between the two states is relatively the same. Overall, gender appears to be a significant factor in the frequency of traffic stops."

    "text": "Insights\nThis analysis shows how the frequency and type of traffic stop outcomes (e.g., warnings, arrests, searches) vary by race, gender, and state. Across California, Texas, and North Carolina, white male drivers are stopped most often, but Black and Hispanic individuals—especially males—face higher rates of searches and arrests, particularly in Texas and North Carolina. White drivers, especially females, are more likely to receive warnings. These trends point to consistent disparities and potential bias in traffic enforcement across state lines."

The data set provides detailed information on how consumers celebrate Valentine’s Day annually for over a decade (2010 - 2022) and uses interactive charts to explore a demographic break down on both spending and gift type. This data set is ideal for exploring and understanding relationships in consumer spending.\n\n# Importing data sets I will analyze \ngifts_age &lt;- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2024/2024-02-13/gifts_age.csv')\n\n\n# Scatter plot visualization of money spent on Valentines Day across different age groups  \nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(tidytuesdayR)\n\nggplot(gifts_age, aes(x = Age, y = SpendingCelebrating, group = 1)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"blue\", size = 3) +  \n  geom_line(color = \"red\", linewidth = 1) + \n  labs(\n    title = \"Percentage of People Spending Money on Valentine's Day by Age\",\n    x = \"Age Group\",\n    y = \"Percentage Spending (%)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere I created a scatterplot to visualizes the percentage of people spending money on Valentine’s Day across different age groups. The x-axis represents various age groups, while the y-axis indicates the percentage of individuals in each group who report spending money on the holiday. A red line is used to connect the points, highlighting the trend in spending participation across age demographics.\nThis visualization helps identify spending habits among different generations, showing whether younger or older individuals are more likely to participate financially in Valentine’s Day celebrations.\nData Source:\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/datasets/infinator/happy-valentines-day-2022\nAuthor: National Retail Federation (NRF)\nThis data was sourced from the TidyTuesday project, which provides weekly data challenges for the R community. Specifically, the dataset focuses on consumer spending on valentine’s Day:\n- The dataset originates from the National Retail Federation’s annual Valentine’s Day surveys and last updated November 2024.\n- Data spans from 2010 to 2022 and examines spending habits by age group.\n- This dataset provides insights into planned spending on different types of gifts and overall spending participation."
