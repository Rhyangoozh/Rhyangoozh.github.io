    "text": "In this project, I analyze consumer spending on Valentines Day using the Tidy Tuesday Valentine’s Day survey data from the National Retail Federation (NRF) Valentine’s Day Data Center. The data set provides detailed information on how consumers celebrate Valentine’s Day annually for over a decade (2010 - 2022) and uses interactive charts to explore a demographic break down on both spending and gift type.

The findings highlight how Netflix has adapted its catalog over time based on consumer preferences and market demands. The analysis focuses on two key aspects: the most commonly produced genres and the relationship between movie lengths and release years.\nMy first bar chart displays the top 10 most frequently produced genres on Netflix, with Drama, Comedy, and International Movies and TV shows leading. These genres dominate the platform’s library, suggesting that Netflix has prioritized them in response to audience demand. Netflix’s heavy investment in Drama indicates a strategic response to consumer preference for emotionally engaging narratives, while Comedy’s strong presence suggests sustained demand for lighthearted entertainment. The high production of International entertainment reflects the growing interest in informative, worldly-based content, likely driven by increased global accessibility, audience demand for diverse storytelling, and Netflix’s expansion into non-English markets to attract and retain subscribers worldwide.\nThe scatter plot reveals a slight decreasing trend in movie lengths from 1940 to 2020. This suggests a shift toward shorter films, potentially reflecting changing viewer habits, such as a preference for more concise content in the streaming era. Given Netflix’s data-driven approach, this trend likely influenced its decision to produce shorter movies, catering to modern audiences who favor engaging, time-efficient content.\nTo make the trend clearer, the second plot groups movie lengths by decade, reducing the noise from individual data points in the scatter plot. This broader view highlights more distinct shifts over time, making it easier to see how Netflix’s production aligns with evolving consumer preferences.\nData Source: Netflix Movies and TV Shows Dataset https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/netflix-shows?select=netflix_titles.csv\nAuthor: Shivam Bansal\nThis dataset, sourced from Kaggle, originates from Flixable, a third-party Netflix search engine.
