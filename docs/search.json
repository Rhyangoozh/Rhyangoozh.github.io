The findings highlight how Netflix has adapted its catalog over time based on consumer preferences and market demands. The analysis focuses on two key aspects: the most commonly produced genres and the relationship between movie lengths and release years.\nMy first bar chart displays the top 10 most frequently produced genres on Netflix, with Drama, Comedy, and International Movies and TV shows leading. These genres dominate the platform’s library, suggesting that Netflix has prioritized them in response to audience demand. Netflix’s heavy investment in Drama indicates a strategic response to consumer preference for emotionally engaging narratives, while Comedy’s strong presence suggests sustained demand for lighthearted entertainment. The high production of International entertainment reflects the growing interest in informative, worldly-based content, likely driven by increased global accessibility, audience demand for diverse storytelling, and Netflix’s expansion into non-English markets to attract and retain subscribers worldwide.\nThe scatter plot reveals a slight decreasing trend in movie lengths from 1940 to 2020. This suggests a shift toward shorter films, potentially reflecting changing viewer habits, such as a preference for more concise content in the streaming era. Given Netflix’s data-driven approach, this trend likely influenced its decision to produce shorter movies, catering to modern audiences who favor engaging, time-efficient content.\nTo make the trend clearer, the second plot groups movie lengths by decade, reducing the noise from individual data points in the scatter plot. This broader view highlights more distinct shifts over time, making it easier to see how Netflix’s production aligns with evolving consumer preferences.\nData Source: Netflix Movies and TV Shows Dataset https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/netflix-shows?select=netflix_titles.csv\nAuthor: Shivam Bansal\nThis dataset, sourced from Kaggle, originates from Flixable, a third-party Netflix search engine. It contains information about movies and TV shows available on Netflix since 2019, including:\n\nAttributes such as title, genre, language, release year, and rating.\nInsights into patterns related to content production, genre trends, and the evolution of media consumption.\nIntegration with external datasets like IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes for deeper analysis.\nThe data was last updated on Kaggle by Shivam Bansal."

The red dashed line represents the observed difference between the two groups. From the permutation test, we calculated the observed difference in proportions as 0.0484. The p-value from the test is 1, which is greater than the significance level of 0.05, so we fail to reject the null hypothesis.\nThe 95% confidence interval for the difference in proportions is [0.0484, 0.0484], meaning that all permuted values are identical, which suggests no variation in the results. Therefore, based on this analysis, we conclude that NHL players are not significantly more likely to be born in the first quarter of the year compared to the general Canadian population.\nHowever, it’s important to note that the relative age effect (RAE) is a well-documented phenomenon in hockey and other sports, particularly at the youth and junior levels, where players born in the first quarter of the year have a competitive advantage. This effect has been widely recognized and may play a role in creating the perception that NHL players are disproportionately born early in the year. It’s possible that other factors—such as sample size, variations in the dataset, or the specific nature of the NHL player pool—could explain the discrepancy between our findings and what the literature typically reports.\nData Source:\nTidyTuesday Dataset – January 9, 2024\nData for this analysis was sourced from the TidyTuesday GitHub repository for the week of January 9, 2024.
