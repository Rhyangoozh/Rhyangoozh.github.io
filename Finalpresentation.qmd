## The Netflix Titles Project

-   String analysis and regular expressions  
-   Questions that came about:  
    -  What kinds of stories am I drawn to?  
    -  What patterns reflect culture, identity, or emotion?  
-   Used project to express a niche, personal way of engaging with data  
    -  558 titles contain the word “The”  
    -  42 titles include a four-digit year, like “1994” or “2020”

## Final Thoughts

-   My website is more than a class project—it's a living example of:  
    -   How I connect analytical tools with personal interests  
    -   A chance to build something personal beyond just my technical skills  
    -   A tool I’ll continue using to reflect who I am and who I’m becoming.
