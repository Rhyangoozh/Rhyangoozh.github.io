## Introduction

-   Hi, I’m Rhyan Goozh.
-   This presentation focuses on the application of my website: how it represents me not just as a student, but as someone entering the professional world.
-   I’ve used data science as a tool to express curiosity, personality, and direction.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Purpose of the Website

-   Beyond completing assignments, I built this site to:
    -   Showcase my thinking
    -   Highlight my interests
    -   Create a personal, data-driven introduction to who I am
-   I want the site to feel like a portfolio that reflects more than just skills.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The Netflix Titles Project

-   I used string analysis and regular expressions to explore content themes.
-   Instead of just following the assignment, I asked questions to reflect how I think:
-   What kinds of stories am I drawn to?
-   What patterns reflect culture, identity, or emotion?
-   By following my curiosity through the data, I used the project to express a niche, personal way of engaging with the world.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Personalizing Data Science

-   The project helped me realize:
    -   I’m drawn to the stories that come from statistics.
    -   Data can be used creatively—not just to measure, but to reveal how we think.
-   By building this site, I’m not only learning tools—\
    I’m showing how I think and what matters to me.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Application in Adult Life

-   This site is something I can actually use:
    -   As a talking point in interviews
    -   To demonstrate how I approach complex problems
    -   To highlight curiosity and initiative beyond a resume
-   It's a way of presenting myself through work, not just talking about it.
- As I move into the next stage of life, I want this site to bring together all parts of me—personal, academic, and professional.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Final Thoughts

-   My website is more than a class project—it's a living example of:
    -   How I connect analytical tools with personal interests
    -   A chance to build something personal beyond just my technical skills
    - A tool I’ll continue using to reflect who I am and who I’m becoming.
-   Thanks for listening!
